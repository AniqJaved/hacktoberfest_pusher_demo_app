# Pusher Dev Hacktoberfest Contributor Guide 

Hacktoberfest 2022 is finally here and weâ€™re super excited to be taking part his year. We rely on the contributions of open source developers in the community to make our APIâ€™s accessible to others and are looking forward to seeing what the Pusher Devs come up with!

## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is an annual festival hosted by DigitalOcean that takes place in the month of October to celebrate the open source community. For 31 days contributors and open source maintenance are encouraged to dedicate time to working on some open source projects and win some swag to mark the occasion. 

## Background on Pusher

We provide bi-directional hosted APIs that are flexible, scalable and easy to use. We create and maintain complex messaging infrastructure so you can build the realtime features your users need, fast.

With our APIâ€™s you can build anything that requires realtime functionality such as chat, gaming, charts, location tracking, presence indicators and more.

On top of our API we also offer features that help developers build faster such as cache channels, users model and subscription count.

## How can you participate?

- Tackle one of our open issues
- Submit a demo application powered by Pusher
- Write a tutorial 
- Write a blog post about an application you built with Pusher

Hereâ€™s what you need to do to win some Pusher swag:

- If you make one contribution youâ€™ll win a Pusher sticker pack
- For two contributions youâ€™ll get a sticker pack and a pair of Pusher socks
- Three or more contributions? Weâ€™ll give you all of the above and a t-shirt!

**Special prize: If you use any of the new Pusher features in any of your contributions (cache channels, users model and subscription count) youâ€™ll win the full swag pack! **

Swag reveal coming soon ðŸ‘€

*To also be eligible for the DigitalOcean prizes youâ€™ll need to register at the Hacktoberfest website here - https://hacktoberfest.com/ and make 4 accepted PR requests before October 31st.*

## Tips for contributors

- PRâ€™s beyond our open issues are welcome but make sure your contributions are meaningful and beneficial to other users otherwise your PR may be closed and    marked as â€˜invalidâ€™.
- Issues before PRâ€™s. If you plan to make a contribution, please make sure there is an issue for it. You can either find an existing issue or open a new     issue if none exists.
- Have a read of the Pusher community code of conduct to help us maintain a safe and inclusive environment for the community and Pusher team here:          https://pusher.com/code-of-conduct
